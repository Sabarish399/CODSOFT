This repository contains a collection of Java-based mini projects developed as part of my internship. These projects cover a range of real-world applications and demonstrate basic to intermediate Java concepts including object-oriented programming, file handling, user interface development with Swing/AWT, and API consumption.


Task 1: Number Game
- A console-based game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
- The game progresses through 3 difficulty rounds with limited attempts.
- Features attempt tracking and progressive difficulty.

Task 2: Student Grade Calculator
- Takes marks for multiple subjects and calculates total, average, and grade.
- Handles input validation and supports dynamic number of subjects.

Task 3: ATM Interface
- A simple graphical ATM interface built with Java AWT.
- Users can deposit, withdraw, and check balance.
- UI interactions are handled using buttons and dialogs.

Task 4: Currency Converter (Real-time Exchange Rates)
- GUI application using Swing.
- Fetches real-time exchange rates using [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).
- Allows currency conversion between multiple currencies (USD, INR, EUR, etc.).

Task 5: Student Management System
- Can Add, remove, search, and display student records.
- Stores student information including roll number, name, and grade.
- Supports file storage and retrieval using text file.
- Built with OOP principles and file I/O.
